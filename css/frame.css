/* having the separate frame for html build is ok, but also needed the css - since so much css stuff might
be special for the new html. Thus, this frame.css is imported (@import) into the master css - do not 
need to reference this file directly in the frame.html.

After the frame html and styling is done, copy the new css stuff into the main. Note, leave the .notice
class in here as holding place. Put new css code further down. */
